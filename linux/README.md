## Welcome to the Linux Series!

In this series, we unravel the essential elements of Linux for aspiring DevOps engineers in a 7 step format. Remember, this journey doesn't end here. Linux offers a vast array of features and capabilities, and understanding these topics is just the tip of the iceberg.

**Below are the 7 topics:**
1. [day-1 (fliesystem-structure)](./day-1%20(fliesystem-structure)/)
2. [day-2 (basic-linux-commands)](./day-2%20(basic-linux-commands)/)
3. [day-3 (file-permissions)](./day-3%20(file-permissions)/)
4. [day-4 (user-groups)](./day-4%20(user-groups)/)
5. [day-5 (package-management)](./day-5%20(package-management)/)
6. [day-6 (ssh-and-secure-access)](./day-6%20(ssh-and-secure-access)/)
7. [day-7 (shell-scripting)](./day-7%20(shell-scripting)/)

> **Bonus:** [lab-for-handson](./lab-for-handson/)

### Important Notes:
1. Commands are not copy-paste friendly. Write and adapt them into your muscle memory as the content is beginner-friendly without prior experience.
2. Special mention for `vim` or `nano` (text editors) self-study as they are not part of the series.
3. Each day includes a `task.md` file for you to practice and get a better understanding of the topic. Please don't restrict yourself to these tasks and feel free to either google or use your creativity.

Wish you Good Luck :confetti_ball: , Let's grow together :seedling:
