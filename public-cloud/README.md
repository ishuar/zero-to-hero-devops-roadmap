## Friendly Tip

As part of our Zero to Hero DevOps roadmap series, here's a crucial tip: Avoid jumping into multicloud deployments too soon. Instead, start by mastering one cloud platform thoroughly. Whether it's AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, focus your efforts on understanding its services and best practices.

After mastering one cloud provider, explore other sections of the repository to deepen your knowledge. Once you feel confident, you can gradually move on to learning about additional cloud platforms. Remember, the goal is to build a strong foundation first before branching out.
